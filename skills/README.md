# Skills

A **skill** is a portable, tool-agnostic capability: a folder containing a
`SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and a Markdown
body, optionally bundling scripts or reference files alongside it. The agent
only loads a skill's `description` until it decides the skill is relevant, then
reads the full body — *progressive disclosure*.

`SKILL.md` is supported across Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI,
Copilot (agent mode), Cline, Roo Code, Goose, and more — so a skill written here
is **not locked to one agent**.

## Layout

```
skills/
  _template/SKILL.md     # copy this to start a new skill
  <skill-name>/SKILL.md  # one folder per skill (+ optional scripts/, refs/)
```

## Built-in (general, project-agnostic)

These ship with the Efes skeleton and apply to any project:

- **`wrap-session`** — the end-of-session ritual: update the memory bank, run the
  Definition of Done. The rot-guard for the vibe lane.
- **`write-adr`** — scaffold a numbered ADR from the template.
- **`review-own-diff`** — self-review a change against the Definition of Done
  before declaring it done.
- **`clean-code`** — general code-quality rules (small single-responsibility
  files, naming, error handling, "why" comments, no god classes).
- **`write-tests`** — drive a change with tests: turn acceptance criteria into a
  failing test first, pin behavior/contracts, keep the suite green.
- **`ponytail`** — minimal-code discipline (vendored from
  [upstream](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail), MIT): the "does this
  need to exist" ladder — YAGNI → reuse → stdlib → native → installed dep →
  one line → minimum code. Governs *how much* code exists; `clean-code` governs
  its shape.
- **`caveman`** — terse chat output (vendored from
  [upstream](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman), MIT): drops filler,
  pleasantries, and hedging from responses (~65% fewer output tokens);
  technical content stays exact. Conversation only — never repo files.
- **`spec-feature`** — scaffold a feature spec from the template before
  writing code.
- **`provider-audit`** — check external vendors sit behind an adapter, not
  called directly from domain code.
- **`module-boundary-check`** — check domains don't import each other
  directly and shared contracts live in one place.
- **`commit-msg`** — format/validate a commit message against the chosen
  convention, only once a commit has been explicitly asked for.
- **`specialize-agents`** — fill or refresh the 4 vendored agent files'
  project-orientation blocks with this project's real paths and commands.

## Wiring (per tool in use)

This folder is the **single source**; no skill content is ever duplicated into
a tool's format. But each tool discovers skills natively so that only the
frontmatter `description` is loaded until a skill is actually needed
(progressive disclosure — cheaper than reading every body every session):

- **Claude Code** — symlink each skill folder into `.claude/skills/`:
  `ln -s ../../skills/<name> .claude/skills/<name>`. **Ships pre-wired** in the
  skeleton for every built-in skill.
- **Other tools** (Cursor, Codex, Gemini, …) — their native skill/rule
  location, pointing back here; generated on demand for tools actually in
  use (`AGENTS.md` §7). Not pre-wired in this fork — only Claude Code is.

Re-run/update the wiring whenever a skill is added or removed.

## Project-specific (added after the interview)

Once the stack and project type are known, the agent should **research and add
skills that fit this project** — from public skill registries or the web — as
new folders here (e.g. a framework's conventions, a testing approach, an API
client pattern). Keep each skill small, single-purpose, and in the repo language.

> Adding a non-trivial skill is a decision: note it in `docs/memory/decisions.md`
> (and an ADR if it changes how the project is built).

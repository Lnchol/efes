# Changelog — Efes skeleton

Versions of the **skeleton itself**, so a forked project knows what it diverged
from and can cherry-pick upstream improvements. Forks: keep this file as-is (or
delete it); your own history lives in `docs/memory/progress.md`.

## v0.7.0 — 2026-07-21

- Made the repo public. One command drops the files straight into whatever
  folder you're already in — `curl -sL
  https://github.com/Lnchol/efes/tarball/main | tar xz --strip-components=1`
  — no GitHub account, no new repo, no `.git`, no placeholder folder name.
- `LICENSE` now explicitly permits anyone given access to the repo to use,
  copy, modify, and build on it for their own projects
  ([ADR-0008](docs/architecture/adr/0008-harden-for-sharing.md)).
- Removed the enforced general-manager model default
  (`.claude/settings.json` deleted, `.codex/config.toml`'s `model =`
  commented out) so copying this template can't fail on a model the copier
  doesn't have access to; `AGENTS.md` §10 / `EFES.md` §2F now recommend a
  model instead of enforcing one.
- Added 5 skills (`spec-feature`, `provider-audit`, `module-boundary-check`,
  `commit-msg`, `specialize-agents`) and fixed all 12 skills' wiring into
  `.claude/skills/` (previously documented as pre-wired but never actually
  linked).
- `HOW-TO-USE.md` split out of `README.md` and rewritten in plainer language.

## v0.6.0 — 2026-07-20

- **Established the project identity as Efes**, consistently across every
  file — protocol, docs, historical ADRs, and this changelog. Added a
  proprietary `LICENSE` (owner: Efe)
  ([ADR-0006](docs/architecture/adr/0006-project-identity-and-license.md)).
- **Vendored a fixed 4-role agent delegation roster** — `code-explorer` →
  `fast-task-executor` / `hard-task-specialist` → `validation-runner` — as
  generic templates in both `.claude/agents/*.md` (Claude Code) and
  `.codex/agents/*.toml` (Codex CLI), each carrying a `{{...}}`
  project-orientation block filled by a future Efes interview. The
  **general manager is the top-level session itself** (no 5th orchestrator
  agent), defaulted to Fable 5 for Claude Code (`.claude/settings.json`) and
  a placeholder flagship model for Codex (`.codex/config.toml`)
  ([ADR-0007](docs/architecture/adr/0007-vendor-agent-role-pipeline.md)).
  `AGENTS.md` §10 documents the roster; `EFES.md` §0.1/§2F/§4/§6 updated so
  Mode B **specializes** (never recreates) these files.
- **Tool wiring changed:** added `GEMINI.md` (thin wrapper, ships by
  default); documented that Codex CLI reads `AGENTS.md` natively (no
  wrapper needed); dropped Cursor from the default roster (`AGENTS.md` §7,
  `skills/README.md` §Wiring) — add it back on demand if it comes into use.
- Identity/vision/stack placeholders in `AGENTS.md` are deliberately left as
  `{{...}}` — no concrete project exists yet; they're filled the next time
  this repo is forked and its own `EFES.md` interview is run.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-07-12

- **Cursor ships by default** alongside Claude Code:
  `.cursor/rules/000-start-here.mdc` (alwaysApply pure pointer — read order,
  always-on skills, end-of-session checklist). `AGENTS.md` §7, `EFES.md`
  §1/§4/§F, `skills/README.md` §Wiring, and `README.md` updated to match.
- Bootstrap ritual clarified: forks **reset `progress.md`** to their own first
  entry (skeleton maintenance history stays upstream); `decisions.md` keeps the
  inherited skeleton-decision lines; `LICENSE` is rewritten with the fork's
  own license + owner (new interview §A question — no `{{...}}`, so the guard
  can't catch it). Interview now suggests a code-navigation
  MCP (e.g. Serena) post-scaffold and stack-idiom pre-commit hooks (husky /
  `pre-commit`).

## v0.4.0 — 2026-07-11

- Governance hardening ([ADR-0005](docs/architecture/adr/0005-governance-hardening.md)):
  `progress.md` rotation rule, canonical session ritual (`ai-session-protocol.md`)
  with wrappers deduplicated, thin-wrapper re-sync step, prompt-cache stability
  rule, post-interview placeholder guard, `EFES.md` post-bootstrap removal,
  skeleton versioning (this file), native per-tool skill wiring in the interview,
  a post-interview prune step (delete non-applicable sections instead of leaving
  empty templates), root `SECURITY.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json` ignored.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-07-11

- Vendored `ponytail` (minimal-code discipline) and `caveman` (terse chat
  output) as always-on built-in skills
  ([ADR-0004](docs/architecture/adr/0004-vendor-ponytail-caveman-skills.md)).

## v0.2.0 — 2026-06-19

- Test-first discipline baked in ([ADR-0003](docs/architecture/adr/0003-test-first-discipline.md));
  `skills/write-tests/`; `docs/process/security.md`; logging conventions;
  PR template with the DoD checklist.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-13

- Initial skeleton: `AGENTS.md`, `EFES.md` protocol, docs tree, memory bank,
  built-in skills, templated CI, ADR-0001/0002.
